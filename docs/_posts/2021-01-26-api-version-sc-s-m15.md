There are three versions of the WebAPI.

1. API v1 - PTP over TCP/IP
2. API v2 - OSC protocol with sessionID
3. API v2.1 - OSC protocol without sessionID. Images can be downloaded by URI.

The specific THETA model support is documented on the [THETA API Introduction](https://api.ricoh/docs/theta-api-introduction/) on the RICOH Developer Connection site.

Most cameras, including the S, SC, V, SC2, SC2, and Z1 use the v2.1 API specification.  This API is easier to
use as it does not require specifying a session ID.  Images on the camera can be downloaded with a simple
GET call to the URI of the image.  You can get the URI of the images from listImages.
