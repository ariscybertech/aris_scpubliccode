According to GitHub's [The State of the Octoverse](https://octoverse.github.com/#top-languages), Dart was the fastest growing language in 2019,
growing faster than Go, Rust, and TypeScript.  

The interest in Dart is largely driven by [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

JAXenter readers also [ranked Dart](https://jaxenter.com/poll-results-dart-word-2019-154779.html) as the most relevant language of 2019.

## Dart and RICOH THETA

This project focuses on using Dart from the command line.  
After getting familiar with Dart language syntax, we 
plan to develop mobile app projects with Flutter in the future.
